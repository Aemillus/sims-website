### Update gallery images
- add files to the dropbox in `rcrcsims/gallery/`
- each new image requires two files with identical names except one has `_THUMB` appended, for example `EbolaCasesTimeSeries_THUMB.png` and `EbolaCasesTimeSeries.png`
- file type should be .jpg, .jpeg, or .png
- the thumbnail should have a 1:1 aspect ratio, at least 150x150 pixels (though they currently display at 88x88), and as small as possible (less than 50kb)
- the full size image can probably have height < 900px for portrait or width < 1200px for landscape and should be around 500kb or less
